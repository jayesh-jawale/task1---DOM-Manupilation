        <div id="right"><p><b>JavaScript</b> is a scripting or <b>programming</b> language that allows you to implement complex features on web pages — every time a web page does more than just sit there and display static information for you to look at — displaying timely content updates, interactive maps, animated 2D/3D graphics, scrolling video jukeboxes, etc. — you can bet that JavaScript is probably involved. It is the third layer of the layer cake of standard web technologies, two of which (HTML and CSS) we have covered in much more detail in other parts of the Learning Area.</p> <br>

        <h4 style="line-height: 20px;">Why to learn Javascript</h4> <br>

        <p>
            <b>JavaScript</b> was once called LiveScript; but due to Java’s popularity, it was rebranded to take advantage of that fame. You could say that the newer language hitched its wagon to the rising star and went along for the ride, attracting its vast following in the process:

                 <li style="padding:20px">
                    JavaScript is the most popular programming language used by professional developers today. Even back-end developers choose JavaScript more often than not.
                 </li>
                 <li style="padding:20px">
                    JavaScript is, without question, the default language of the internet. You need to look no further than your browser for proof since JavaScript was most likely used to develop it. Since browsers are a necessary part of any user’s online experience, it’s easy to see why JavaScript is so significant.
                 </li>
                 <li style="padding:20px">
                    JavaScript has many uses that go beyond its traditional internet roles. It powers smart televisions, works with the internet of things (IoT), creates native apps for iOS and Android, and builds cross-platform desktop apps, to name a few.

                 <li style="padding:20px">
                    Since it’s already installed on every web browser today, JavaScript spares the rookies from the chore of setting up a development environment. Newcomers can just jump in and start coding. It’s one of the most accessible entries into coding available, a value-add for beginners. There is also a large online community that offers support and advice

                 <li style="padding:20px">
                    Not only is it a natural language to use, but JavaScript is also easy to pick up. JavaScript turns intricate details into abstracts, making things easier for the newcomer. Unlike the higher-level languages, JavaScript has more of a natural language feel to it.

                 <li style="padding:20px">
                    There’s building a web page, and then there’s building a visually appealing web page that attracts the user’s attention and encourages interaction. JavaScript is so versatile that you can use it to easily add cool design elements such as animation, interactive maps, and scrolling video. Organizations and clients want web designers who can not only put together a technically sound page but one that also will lure visitors. If you know JavaScript, you can deliver.
